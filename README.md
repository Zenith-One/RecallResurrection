Recall Resurrection
==============
Recall Resurrection (or just Recall) is a mod about balanced teleportation. Using the inherent magical properties of ender pearls, you can craft Bindstones to store up to 16 locations (one for each Minecraft color), as well as scrolls to travel to those locations. Your bound locations are yours alone, however you may choose to convert a scroll into a sharable version by shift+right clicking with it, which will allow any player who uses that scroll to travel to your bound location.

This mod is in pre-alpha still, so don't expect it to work properly (and do expect it to possibly corrupt your world or player.dat).
